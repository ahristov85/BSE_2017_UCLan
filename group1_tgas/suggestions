Project's presentation - comments and suggestions


1. Giant vs. Dwarf stars: maybe it is better to use different symbols to distinguish the two categories rather 
than different sizes of the same symbol

2. the user has to be able to "come back to the numbers" just looking at the visualization: color is not the best 
way to allow to do that

3. relative metallicities respect to local environment or local velocities: these are important informations. Plot 
them in x and y in order to build a completely different visualization and so compare this one with the first one

4. a similar visualisation can be done using Aladdin or topcat, managing up to 10^6 points. Since Gaia requests to 
manage 10^9 points, this visualization could fit Gaia archive needs. 

5. Moreover about Aladdin: it gives informations from the data table clicking on a point. Create an interface between 
the plot and the table, maybe through zooming (In computer science words: link chart points with field in DB, on 
click - thanks Atanas :) )

6. Lasso tool for the selection of the data -> make multiple plot from the selected stars (HRD, T-[Fe/H]..)

7. Clear rules about the selection parameters
